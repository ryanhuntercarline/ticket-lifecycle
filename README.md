<h2>Ticket Submittal</h2>
<p>

![TicketSubmittal](https://github.com/ryanhuntercarline/ticket-lifecycle/assets/141659465/879eb679-59a9-45a4-b49c-15044a3dc84e)

<p>
Users (or customers) will initiate the service ticket submission process, during which they select a relevant "Help Topic" and provide a concise summary of the issue being reported. As seen above all ticket submittals by users are attached to the user's email address. 

</p>
<br />
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>

  ![Assignment](https://github.com/ryanhuntercarline/ticket-lifecycle/assets/141659465/be6a0ee3-77cb-45ce-8775-05c4eac324ec)

</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<h2>Communication</h2>

After submission, a queue manager will assess the priority, SLA, and assignment for each ticket in the queue, followed by agent actions aligned with the company's SLA protocols and procedures.

</p>
<p>
Upon assignment, it becomes the agent's responsibility to adhere to company guidelines and facilitate effective communication across all pertinent channels, encompassing clients, team-specific agents, other departments, and management, while maintaining a professional and timely approach.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>

</p>
<br />
Once a resolution is reached for the ticket's associated issue, the agent is required to compose a detailed update outlining the problem's resolution and any requisite follow-up actions. Notification to the user (or customer) is essential, and confirmation of the correction should precede the transition of the ticket status to "Resolved."
